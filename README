This repo contains an ocaml xenstore client, a merge of the Mirage and XCP ones.

The aims are:
1. to have a large common policy-free protocol library with unit-tests
2. to allow the use of Lwt or not
3. to run in both Mirage and Unix environments
4. to provide a simpler watch interface without tokens but with cancellation
